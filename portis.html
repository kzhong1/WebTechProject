    <h1>Julia Portis, from St Paul, Minnesota</h1>
    <h2>Went to Mounds Park Academy High School</h2>

    <i>When and how we met: </i>I met Julia Portis Spring semester of sophomore
    year 2021. I remember having a conversation with her in an uber on the way
    to Boston about our mental states, our thoughts on frienships at Babson, and
    what we were seeking in what we believed was a good and fulfilling life in
    college. We clicked in the car because were both at similar mental points in
    our lives. I met her at a time in my life where I didn’t have much direction
    in who I was, who I wanted to be, and my place at Babson. Having this
    conversation with Julia at this time felt so needed and felt so right,
    because we both were struggling and we both felt stuck; all we needed was to
    lean on each other and have each other and we didn’t even know it! But I am
    grateful to have had her at that time and place, Julia Portis thank you for
    being my right person at the right time gal. <br /><br />

    <i>Why Julia inspires me:</i> Julia’s focus on self-growth, self-confidence,
    and self-love/sustainability has been something I’ve looked up to since I
    met her. She lives a life where even though she is focusing on growing
    herself and pushing the bounds for discovering her potential, she always
    leaves room for other people and gives care and love to people 110%. She has
    a beautiful ability to connect with anyone and make everyone feel
    comfortable, welcomed, and at home. While working on herself and caring for
    other people, she is also one of the most academically talented people I
    know. She is incredibly knowledgeable, curious, and an extraordinary writer.
    I will always look up to the way she holds herself and expresses herself.
    Julia balances it all, school, friends, work, and play. <br /><br />

    <strong>Dec 2022 </strong><i>What is Julia up to:</i> In highschool Julia
    taught at Breakthrough Collaborative Twin Cities which she said was the
    hardest summer job of her life, but this is where her passion for education
    sparked. Venturing from Minnesota to the east coast, Julia is now a
    Presidential Scholar at Babson College and is working on writing her honors
    thesis—she is researching the impact that test scores (measured over time)
    and self-efficacy have on academic achievement and sense of self for middle
    school ELL (english language learning) students. At Babson, she is a member
    of Kappa Kappa Gamma, works at the writing center, and babysits. After
    graduating in May 2023, she will move to Boston to work for Accenture as a
    Consulting Analyst. <br /><br />

    <i>Julia's Dreams:</i> Julia’s dreams of wanting to “have an impact on all
    those I encounter and feel a sense of purpose in my life” goes right along
    with the way she carries herself day to day. Through the work she does
    today, it is evident she is able to make positive impacts and changes in
    everything she does for so many people around her. If she can do it now, I
    know she will do even bigger things in the future. When I speak to her about
    what makes her feel alive, she consistently speaks about how she prioritizes
    the sense of home she feels from being connected to certain people. I think
    where she envisions herself and what type of person she wants to be is
    hugely reliant on the connection she has with the people in her life and
    strangers she doesn’t know. Julia’s passion for psychology and wanting to
    understand and help others goes so deep and she will surely turn her passion
    into her dream life's work.
