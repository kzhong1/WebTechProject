    Iris is my best friend from birth, my sister. Her mom and my mom were
    friends when they were pregnant with us back in 2001 - Iris is truly my
    rock, my home. We grew up doing everything together, soccer, ballet,
    skating, Chinese school, and more. We went through elementary school, middle
    school, and high school together; her and I navigated our childhood and teen
    years side by side. Now that we are adults, I am so lucky to have her in my
    life to now navigate my 20s with her. Having Iris Zhao in my life has been
    the greatest gift the universe has ever given me. Doing life with her makes
    life seem like a dream, this friendship is a very important one to me.
    Watching Iris grow into the person she is today has been an absolutely
    beautiful thing to witness. Her and I went from being babies running around
    on the soccer field and on the dance stage to Iris dedicating her life and
    time to figure skating - winning nationals as a juvenile, training 30 hours
    a week, to skating on NYU’s skating team. I look up to Iris and her work
    ethic. She never fails to light up a room with her humor, and I quite
    literally wouldn’t know what I’d without her.
