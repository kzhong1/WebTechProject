    <i>How we met:</i> Sumer and I rushed for the same business fraternity—Alpha
    Kappa Psi, together Fall of 2019—we were a part of the same pledge class (go
    etas!), and we became a part of the same AKPsi family because our bigs (his
    is <a href="lally.html">Chris Lally</a> & mine is
    <a href="ryan.html">Ryan Laverty</a>) are best friends. <br /><br />

    <i>Why Sumer inspires me:</i> Sumer is a special guy, I really consider him
    to be family. I am so grateful to have met him so early in my college life
    because even though we weren’t extremely close freshman to junior year, the
    people we have individually grown into through college and abroad, has made
    us even closer now. Sumer is one of the most mature, kind, funny, energetic
    but zen, intelligent, well-rounded, and hard-working people ever. He is
    curious and leans into passions, interests, and experiences that genuinely
    make him feel alive: this is something that everyone in his life is inspired
    by because he balances life and work while always having fun. He loves
    physical activity, working out, boxing, and cycling, he delves into his
    creative side, dancing, videography, and rapping, and he is committed to
    learning and pushing himself personally and professionally. He told me how
    his past internship at Microsoft was one of the most challenging experiences
    ever; he said that when he was getting feedback or projects from his boss he
    would do box breathing techniques because of how difficult and demanding
    everything was. But this is how Sumer lives life, constantly pushing the
    boundaries for himself and it is a great energy to be around. He has a
    vision of where he wants to be, who he wants to be, and what he will be
    doing in the future. Having a friend who has such a clear picture of the
    growth he wants to be doing now in order to be a person not only he is proud
    of, but his family is proud of is motivating and refreshing. This ambition
    in combination with his genuineness and kindness makes Sumer, Sumer. This is
    what makes him magnetic, and the perfect leader, friend, and person.

    <strong>Dec 2022 </strong><i>What is Sumer up to:</i> Sumer’s proudest high
    school accomplishment was founding the stock market club with his hometown
    best friends. They got invited to the trading floor of the New York Stock
    Exchange after the great success of his club in stock trading competitions.
    After highschool, Sumer got into Babson College where he was a part of
    E-tower and Code. He has been a brother in Alpha Kappa Psi for 4 years, and
    he is now the President of AKPsi! His big Chris Lally was the president of
    AKPsi our freshman year, so he was inspired to follow his mentors footsteps
    and make him proud, a very wholesome full circle moment. Last semester, he
    went abroad to Singapore and studied at SMU (Singapore Management
    University) during Spring 2022, this is where he got deep into cycling and
    muay thai boxing. Sumer worked as a Product Manager at Microsoft the summer
    after Singapore, and he will return to Seattle, WA post-grad in May 2023 to
    be a full time PM at Microsoft. Sumer will audition for Babson’s Dance
    Ensemble next year for his last semester and I am coaching him. He also has
    started a side project called <strong>Sen Studios</strong> with the mission
    statement “Play Redefined”; so far me (Director of Movement),
    <a href="fati.html">Fatima</a> (Creative Director), and Nick Cho (Visual)
    are on the e-board for his creative endeavor. His 1st project was his
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAgfj67T9Go">Iceland Vlog</a> of
    our friend groups 5 day trip, his 2nd project was a painting him and Nick
    Cho bid and sold for $42 - titled “The Internet Killed Me” (pictured below), and he has other
    projects are in the works…Sumer and I will also be running the Ipswich Half
    Marathon together in April 2023 - this will be another Sen Studios video
    project in the making. <br /><br />
