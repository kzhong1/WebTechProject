    <i>When and how we met: </i>Julia Garcia and I met through one of our best
    friends Jana Godbole during our 1st semester of Sophomore year during COVID,
    Fall 2020. We met at a time in our lives where we were both navigating how
    to be independent and happy in our single-era. Now in Fall 2022, we are
    roomates and I have never been happier to get time with her after our
    individual journey's abroad in Italy.<br /><br />

    <i>Why Julia Garcia inspires me:</i> Julia has an energy like no other. Her
    consistent and deep passion for learning, food, family, friends, good
    experiences, meeting new people and trying new things is what makes Julia,
    Julia. This is what makes her a joy to be around. It is not possible for you
    to be in a bad mood if you are around Garcia, her contagious smile and
    laugh, sunshine energy, and upbeat personality light up a room without fail.
    Her curiosity keeps me excited about life, and I am so thankful to have such
    a driven but kind friend in my life. <br /><br />

    <strong>Dec 2022 </strong><i>What is JG up to:</i> Julia was born and raised
    in Mexico, lived in Tennessee for a few years when she was young, came to
    Boston for college, spent a summer learning how to make Mezal while
    interning at a Babson run food start-up, worked for and modeled for a
    well-known fashion consultant in Wellesley, went abroad to Milan, and is now
    a senior at Babson College. Once she graduates she will be working full time
    in Boston with BRG (Berkeley Research Group). <br /><br />

    <i>JG's Dreams:</i> Garcia will be someone big, whether she starts her own
    company, works up to a C-suite position, or ends up doing something so
    unconventional and not like anything she would have ever imagined or thought
    was possible. We’ve talked a lot about not wanting to just fit in the mold
    of who the world expects us to be when we are adults “in the real world”,
    and with the way Julia views the world with such ambition and curiosity, in
    combination with her go, go, go mentality, she is bound to accomplish
    anything. She has big dreams to do something big, beyond what the
    business-school mold expects her to be. Julia will live up to the high
    standards she holds herself to and I can’t wait to see what she does with
    all that fire within her.
