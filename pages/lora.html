    <h1>Lora Stancheva, from Sofia, Bulgaria</h1>
    <h2>Went to UWC China (United World Colleges, China)</h2>

    <i>When and how we met: </i>I met Julia Portis Spring semester of sophomore
    year 2021. I remember having a conversation with her in an uber on the way
    to Boston about our mental states, our thoughts on frienships at Babson, and
    what we were seeking in what we believed was a good and fulfilling life in
    college. We clicked in the car because were both at similar mental points in
    our lives. I met her at a time in my life where I didn’t have much direction
    in who I was, who I wanted to be, and my place at Babson. Having this
    conversation with Julia at this time felt so needed and felt so right,
    because we both were struggling and we both felt stuck; all we needed was to
    lean on each other and have each other and we didn’t even know it! But I am
    grateful to have had her at that time and place, Julia Portis thank you for
    being my right person at the right time gal. <br /><br />

    <div class="story"><strong>The Story of Lora & Kz</strong></div>
    Lora and I’s friendship is not only so important and precious to me, but I
    genuinely value her so much as a person after all that we have been through
    and all that she has done for me. Freshman year for me was the 1st time I
    was finding myself as a person outside of ballet and my hometown, and I am
    so lucky to have had Lora as a roommate to guide me through this exploratory
    phase of my life. Because no matter what happened outside in school, dance,
    or with friends, I knew I would be able to come back to our room and she
    could help me with whatever was going on, be happy for whatever I
    accomplished, or just be there with her presence to make me feel at home.
    There are many moments when I took Lora’s support and unconditional love for
    me for granted, and I realized this during COVID just how incredible of a
    friend Lora was. <br /><br />
    <i>Why Lora inspires me:</i> Lora has taught me a lot about myself, has
    given me priceless advice over these past few years, I credit who I am today
    because of much of her guidance and love. Lora is a badass. A lover. A
    comedian. An artist. A smartie. She is everything. She can do it all. Since
    we met freshman year, I have seen her as someone I want to grow up to be
    like. Through all the projects she takes on, the things she creates, and
    seeing the way she connects with others, I am inspired to do life like she
    does, to the quality that she does. Sometimes people in her life forget that
    she is only in her early 20s, yet is doing the things that full-time CEOs do
    in their 40s, so I see 1st hand how high of a standard Lora puts on herself.
    It motivates me to push my potential in the things I can accomplish and
    handle; she showed me how to always take it a step further in what I am
    passionate about because whether what I pursue—big or small—ends well or
    not, everything is a teaching lesson. Watching how Lora did life in college,
    balancing school, friends, her company, her organizations, and more, and
    learning about her life in Bulgaria and China, this all made me more
    comfortable taking risks with her by my side. Lora makes me feel comfortable
    expressing myself, being myself, having good moments, embracing bad moments,
    and she’s helped me fall in love with myself and the ups/downs of life.

    <strong>Dec 2022 </strong><i>What is Lora up to:</i> Lora was a professional
    rhythmic gymnast for 13 years in Bulgaria. For the sake of her physical and
    mental health, she decided to stop and move to China for boarding school to
    finish high school. She accomplished so much at UWC, the highlight being
    that she organized, produced, and led a professional fashion show at her
    school. She then came to Babson College and is now a part of the other
    largest business fraternity on campus, PGN (Phi Gamma Nu), BDE (Babson Dance
    Ensemble), and runs her own clothing company Wear Trendies. She created Wear
    Trendies during COVID 2020. As the founder, she created, designed, and sells
    the highest quality (bamboo) & sustainable undergarments, socks, underwear,
    boxers, and more. She sells her product in 87 stores in Europe and works
    with companies that make lace and material for luxury lingerie brands. After
    graduating in December 2022, Lora will begin full-time at ACT Commodities as
    a Junior Sales Trader in Amsterdam while running her company. <br /><br />

    <i>Loras's Dreams:</i> When I talk to Lora about where she see’s herself, it
    is crazy because most times she can’t picture herself being successful or
    living up to the expectations of the person that other people believe she
    can become. Again, people forget Lora is a full-time student while running
    her own business so the standards for her are already very high. Lora tells
    me that mentors/co-workers/adults/friends always tell her how amazing Lora
    will be and how many wonderful things she will accomplish, but deep down
    Lora doesn’t see how incredible she actually is, which is why she can’t
    picture herself doing great things. Her end goal in life is of course to “Be
    doing something that makes me fulfilled”, but she is so thoughtful in that
    she wants to work hard these next few years after graduation to make enough
    money to help her parents retire, especially her Dad, who is a mid-50 year
    old surgeon constantly working under high stress and for long hours. She
    wants to end up running her own company that provides some sort of soft-ware
    as a service, because having experience with clothing and inventory, she
    knows for sure she doesn’t want to create something that has a physical
    product. We’ve talked about hopefully in 15-20 years we can start and run
    our own company together, because we work very well, efficiently, and we
    know how to communicate with each other and how to get. shit. done.
