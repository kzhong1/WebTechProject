    <h1>Bambi Nandabhiwat, from Thailand</h1>
    <h2>Went to Northfield Mount Hermon High School</h2>

    <i>When and how we met: </i>Bambi goes to Babson College and rushed for
    Alpha Kappa Psi during her second semester of freshman year in January 2021.
    We met at the 1st information session during the recruiting season for
    AKPsi. I ended up only talking to her for the entire 2-hour networking
    session, and it was honestly the best conversation I had had with a person I
    had just met after coming back from abroad the previous semester. It was the
    type of conversation that got me self-reflecting, remotivated, and
    reinspired. <br /><br />

    <i>Why Bambi inspires me:</i> I always forget she is two years younger than
    me because the way she carries herself is so incredibly mature. She is
    consistent in who she is and what she values and she inspired me to apply
    for Fulbright Teaching in Thailand. I have never met a more caring, yet
    driven, and humble individual. <br /><br />

    <strong>Dec 2022 </strong><i>What is Bambi up to:</i> Currently a Sophomore (2022), has her own dip business in Thailand (IG @skinnydipdip), works
    part-time at a French bakery, founded the Babson Fragrance Club with
    friends, member of the Alpha Kappa Psi Co-ed Business Fraternity, member of
    Babson’s Asian-Pacific Student Association<br /><br />

    <i>Bambi's Dreams:</i> We haven’t spoken specifically about where Bambi sees
    herself in 10 years and what she is specifically doing. She reminds me of
    myself because she is an individual that has so many passions and
    people/hobbies that make her light up, so she is not the type to just decide
    what she wants to dedicate her life to now. I’d want her to dip her feet
    into everything that makes her curious and slowly find out what makes her
    feel alive - which is what she is already doing. Whatever she ends up doing
    it will make a significant impact on other people and it will fulfill her.
