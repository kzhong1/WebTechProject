    <h1>Jana (Sanjana) Godbole, from Mumbai, India</h1>
    <h2>Went to Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut</h2>

    <i>When and how we met: </i>I met Jana the first day of BDE’s (Babson Dance Ensemble’s) auditions Fall of 2019. She was wearing an iconic fries t-shirt, and from that day, she ruled BDE’s hip hop world and I ruled BDE's contemporary world. We rushed AKPsi together Fall 2019 as well and later became brothers in the same pledge class, go Etas! 
    <br /><br />

    <i>Why Jana inspires me:</i> Jana is an incredible combination of fire, passion, and genuineness. The best thing about her is that she is consistent: consistent in the way she thinks, in the things she values, and in the way she treats people. She is an artistic genius in dancing, singing, and acting. She is quick on her feet, a top-tier problem solver, and I’ve quite literally never met anyone more efficient and precise in the way they think and express themselves. The way Jana moves through life inspires me because she is unapologetic in being herself. She completely immerses herself in the experiences and people that peak her curiosity. She invests her time and energy in matters that 100% connect to her passions, her values, and her self-growth; these are the kinds of people I want in my life.  <br /><br />

    <strong>Dec 2022 </strong><i>What is Jana up to:</i> Jana was born in London and lived there until she was 9 years old, then she moved to Mumbai until she was 15, after her parents moved to New York City for work, so she spent her formative years (15-18 yrs old) in NYC and Connecticut at boarding school (Choate Rosemary Hall), she now attends Babson College and is a senior as well. She went abroad to Milan with Julia Garcia Spring 2022 and is currently working in London, Fall 2022. During holidays and school breaks she spends her time with family back home in either NYC or India. <br /><br />

    Top 3 memories:<br>
   <strong>Preface</strong>: Jana and I have known each other since freshman year, but we only really got close close second semester sophomore year after we both became single. Jana is the one who introduced me to the endless possibilities of my life by pushing me out of my comfort zone and inviting me into her life. I hope she knows just how grateful I am for her unconditional love, patience, and belief in me now and back then during a dark time of my life. We both went abroad to take a break from Babson Fall ‘21/Spring ’22, and it was the best thing to ever happen to us. I went abroad to Italy in the fall, then she went in the Spring, and now she is working in London while I am at Babson. I haven’t been able to be with, live, or travel with Jana since sophomore year, which is why my top 3 memories with her are outdated and they will definitely be rewritten now that Jana and I have 1) found a new side of ourselves, exuding genuine confidence and grace, and 2) we now truly feel happy with life.

      <li>After Big/Little reveal in Rhode Island 2019</li>
      <li>Jana’s 21st Bday in NYC</li>
      <li>Short term living with you in NYC summer 2021</li>
    </ol>
    P.S I physically cannot wait to make new, happy memories with you for our last semester at Babson

    <i>Jana's Dreams:</i> Jana’s future is open to So. Many. Things. She is too talented and intelligent to be confined to one thing and one dream at 21. The amount of knowledge she has from the experience of growing up in 3 countries and meeting hundreds and hundreds of people from all over the world is a testament to how expansive her future is. I know she will do and accomplish unimaginable things and I am so excited to see what she does and who she becomes. I quite literally will always be Jana’s #1 fan.
