    <h1>Jason Shatsky, from Boca, FL</h1>
    <h2>Went to Olympic Heights High School</h2>

    <i>When and how we met: </i>I met Shatsky back in 2019 during my freshman
    year through all my e-tower/AKPsi friends who I met because of AKPsi (Ryan,
    Chris, Hayoung, etc). We only got close during Fall/Winter of 2021/2022
    post-COVID. After my mental health healed after COVID, I was more inspired
    to live up to my true potential, to take on my career, and the possibility
    of doing projects and meeting people I knew would help me become the best
    version of myself. This is why strengthening my friendship with Shatsky was
    so healthy for me: I am a chronic overthinker, and he always knows how to
    rationalize problems I am having with myself, friends, and my future while
    also being actionable in helping me find solutions. He made me realize the
    definition of curating a life I am proud to live. <br /><br />

    <i>Why Jason inspires me:</i> This is one piece of advice he gave me at a
    low moment and it is the roadmap of how I live my life everyday...
    <br /><br />

      <i
        >“Yea there’s alot of day to day stuff that can feel overwhelming. And
        I’m not perfect at it. But what I recommend is really think about what
        inspires you. I think when you’re a student there’s so much going on in
        life that’s just there. Once you leave school you can be more
        intentional (I’m not just talking about people) People, places, things
        etc. Think about how everyone knows the stuff I care about. First
        identify that then create big goals for yourself”</i

    Jason cares about 3 things, family, friends, and his work. He inspires me
    because like he says, anyone can see the 3 essential things he cares about
    in the life he has curated for himself: his family, friends, and work. He
    has been a great role model in showing me that when you care deeply about
    something, you intentionally put in the time and energy and heart into it in
    order to make your dreams come true.

    <i>What is Jason up to:</i> After applying to Babson and getting deferred
    senior year of highschool, Jason started his freshman year in college in
    Florida. With resilience, he successfully became a student at Babson and
    kickstarted the dream life he always knew he could attain. He was an active
    member of e-tower (a living space for entrepreneurs) and started his
    business TicketRev. Jason Shatsky is the CEO & Co-founder of TicketRev--a
    reverse marketplace for event tickets-- which in short terms is a platform
    that makes it cheaper for concert/show-go-ers to find tickets to their
    favorite live events. When COVID arose, the concert and show industry took a
    huge hit, despite this discouraging environmental shift, Jason kept
    resilient and worked his a** off to make TicketRev what it is today.
