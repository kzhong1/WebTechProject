    Through every stage and season of your life, you meet a lot of different
    people.<br />
    I used to take the people I had in my life for granted; I believed genuinely
    good people outside of my family didn't exist, so I always saw people as
    temporary.<br />
    The pandemic pushed me to realize exactly how special the people in my life
    are. <br />The people I dedicate this website to are not only incredibly
    influential to me, but they are consistenlty kind-hearted and influential to
    others. <br />
    I took time to reflect on how I got so lucky to be surrounded by these
    "one-in-a-million" type of people...<br />
    In short, this reflection showed me that I was gifted with the permanence of
    good people with good hearts in my life.<br /><br />
    There is so much to learn about yourself and the world from everyone you
    cross paths with. <br />The lessons I have learned makes me feel deeply
    appreciative for those who leave deep influences on me.<br />I now know that
    I am who I am because of the incredible people in my life. <br />I wouldn't
    be who I am today & I wouldn't have acheived the things I have achieved
    without my family, friends, and mentors. <br /><br />
    This website is a daily reminder to tell everyone in your life that you are
    grateful for them. <br />Life feels good when you surround yourself with
    inspiring, kind, and ambitious humans. <br /><br />
    Thank you to the people in my life for loving me unconditionally, bringing
    out the best in me, and being patient with me. <br />
    You are the ones who have helped become the happy & healthy person I am
    today.<br />
    And for that I not only want to say thank you, I want to express how
    eternally grateful I am for each and everyone of you.
    <br />I seriously love you.
