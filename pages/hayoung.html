    <h1>Aishwarya Suresh, from Cupertino, CA</h1>
    <h2>Went to Monta Vista High School </h2>

    <i>When and how we met: </i>I rushed with Aishwarya Fall 2019 of freshman year, we are both part of the eta class! I got close to Aishwarya 2nd semester of sophomore year 2021. She is a huge part of my life now and I feel grateful that without fail, I learn something new about myself and what I want in life every time I spend quality time with her.  <br /><br />

    <i>Why Aishwarya inspires me:</i> Ever since I’ve known Aishwarya I’ve looked up to her and felt inspired by the work she does. She is the epitome of hardworking and dedicated, she is always working, planning an event, planning a trip, having a 1-on-1 with someone, helping a friend out, looking out for her family, working on her business, applying to jobs, and more. I think it is quite difficult these days to find someone who is as caring and thoughtful but also dedicated to their passion and work as Aish is. When you are with her she is always present and ready to listen, help, or just be there for a good time. I appreciate that she is honest with herself and honest with others, and speaks her mind with elegance and believes in her opinions. On bad days, this girl keeps everyone in her life going with a smile and nothing but support. Aish is present and active in everything she does and commits to, 110%.

    <br /><br />

    <strong>Dec 2022 </strong><i>What is Aish up to:</i>  In high school Aish started a social initiative that empowered low-income students in Indian slums through a Leadership and Entrepreneurship program. She was able to teach in India because of this! She later started her business, Enrole with her high school classmates (and she is now the CMO)—Enrole is a mobile application that uses AI to match recruiters with job-seekers. Now at Babson College she is a CWEL scholar, is a part of AKPsi, and was a part of E-tower and Net Impact. She has taken on so many leadership roles in the organizations she has been a part of, from VP of Membership to VP of Professional Development; which is all another testament to how well Aish is able to balance her work-life balance. Aishwarya will move to NYC for 3 years to work for Morgan Stanley as an Institutional Securities Analyst after she graduates in May 2023.

    <i>Aishwarya's Dreams:</i>Aishwarya cares a lot about other people, people she knows and people she doesn’t know. I genuinely at her core feel and believe that she wants the best for everyone and for everyone to be successful. She knows that everyone is unique and has the potential to grow into their own special selves: having someone as successful and credible as Aishwarya be so open-minded, kind-hearted, and open to mentoring others is so special for the world. She says her dream is to “Make some sort of tangible change in making quality education more accessible”, and I know she will accomplish this and so much more, and I can’t wait to see how many people she helps in the future.
