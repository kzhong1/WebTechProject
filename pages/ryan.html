    <h1>Ryan Laverty, from Cumberland, RI</h1>
    <h2>Went to Cumberland High School </h2>

    <i>When and how we met: </i>Ryan was a senior and a brother in AKPsi when I met him rushing Fall 2019. Once I got into AKPsi, one of the new member requirements was to have 40 1-on-1’s with the existing brothers. Ryan was one of my last meetings and I remember everything about it so vividly. We met outside Rey’s before my rhetoric class and we talked for an hour, but it really felt like 5 minutes. A lot of us knew who Ryan was because he had a huge reputation on campus, so I did research on him before and learned about his accomplishments and endeavors. I remember being nervous to get to know him just because he was so successful and notable, but within a minute of the conversation I felt like I had known him my whole life. We not only talked about his accomplishments, but he opened the question to my goals at Babson and who I wanted to be. I walked away from this conversation literally thinking, the person Ryan grew into senior year because of Babson? I want to be just like him, I want to accomplish the magnitude of things he has accomplished, I want to be as confident as him after 4 years at this school. I am grateful to have met Ryan my first semester of college, because he has consistently been an unbelievable mentor and friend to me through the whirlwind of these past 4 years.<br /><br />

    <i>Why Ryan inspires me:</i> Ryan is one of the most intelligent people in my life, emotionally and academically. All my friends and I consider him to be like Einstein and we all look up to him so much. He is not only accomplished and intelligent, but so humble, so genuine, and down to earth. He cares about finding work-life balance, caring for his family, being there for his friends no matter what, and being the life of the party. He is the hardest worker, yet knows how to have fun, and everyone in his life sees just how much he puts his heart into the people and things that matter. I am lucky to have had him in my life as a source of inspiration during the dark and confusing times of being an underclassmen. A lot of my success, happiness, and confidence comes from the advice and guidance he consistently gave me when I asked for his support. Ryan inspires me because freshman year Kate vowed to herself she would be as successful as he was senior year, and now that I am a senior, I can say that I have done just that.

    <strong>Dec 2022 </strong><i>What is Ryan up to:</i> Ryan founded a public speaking venture which coached people who wanted help with their public speaking skills. He also began the company Foam Family with Chris Lally, his childhood best friend, which is a seat cushion that helps people with their posture and the comfortability of sitting on chairs. They made $2,000 in profit after making over 300 cushions as highschoolers. He was a part of AKPsi and e-Tower and was president of the entrepreneurship living tower for a year before becoming an advisor for it. He then founded and started working on his current venture, Arist, his junior year in 2018. Arist is a text message learning platform, working with organizations to create and deploy text message courses. He participated in the prestigious start-up accelerator program YCombinator in 2020. Arist now has over $16 million in funding.

    <i>Ryan's Dreams:</i>  Ryan is a simple guy, he just wants to “have lots of friends and family and love with the freedom to do what makes me happy”. Even though this man is for sure going to be a billionaire one day and everyone in his life knows he is one of the most gifted people ever, it really doesn’t take a lot to make Ryan happy. He cares a lot about his family, friends, and making good memories. Ryan is living his dream life right now, everyday, and as he is living it, he is also pushing the bounds for what it means for him to be happy and successful! I am so lucky to have him in my life because not only can I learn SO much from him, I get the privilege of watching him become the greatest version of himself through all his accomplishments.
